## Summary

<i> Recipe Retriever </i> is a simple android app designed for anyone that lets me browse through recipes by the cuisine type or gives me an option to shuffle through the database and pull recipes to select from.

## Intended users

* Someone looking to experiment with their taste buds.

  > As someone bored with the same old recipes, I want an app that lets me pick a recipe based on the cuisine type so that I can try a new recipe outside my culture. 

* Someone looking to try a new recipe.

  > As an amateur cook looking to try a new recipe at home, I want an app that lets me choose a selected recipe or shuffle through different recipes that are stored inside the app.

## Functionality

App will have a dropdown button to ask the user to: 

  * Select a specific cuisine type.
  * User will then be able to scroll through different recipes of that cuisine type and chose a recipe they would like to pull the ingredients and instructions for that selected recipe.
  * User will also receive the macronutrient information for that selected recipe such as the protein, carbs and fat.

## Persistent data

* List of recipes.

* Ingredients for recipes.

* Macronutrient information of selected recipe.
